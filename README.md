<h1 align="center">PennyPay</h1>

<p align="center">
PennyPay is the landing page of a fictional online payment platform and alternative to PayPal. Originally, I had started designing it as a landing page for a cryptocurrency platform, but since that trend has died out and Web3 space is on the decline, I decided to rework it into a fictitious competitor to PayPal. The idea behind PennyPay is to offer a fresh, fun and user-friendly payment service that's easy to use and understand, and that provides a more personalized experience for users.
